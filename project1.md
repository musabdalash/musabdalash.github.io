# Crohn's Disease Coding Project


### Project Overview:
In this project, I'll focus on coding Crohn's disease case using the ICD-10-CM system. My goal is to accurately assign codes for various conditions related to Crohn's disease, considering both simple and complex scenarios.


#### Case Study:
   - **Patient Information**: Emily Johnson, 42 years old
   - **Medical History**: Crohn's disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, anemia, depression
   - **Presenting Symptoms**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss
   - **Diagnostic Findings**: Active inflammation in the terminal ileum and cecum
   
#### ICD-10 Codes Assigned:
- `K50.90` (Crohn's disease, unspecified site)
	- **Rationale:** 
		- Emily's colonoscopy confirmed active inflammation in the terminal ileum and cecum, along with ulcerations and strictures.
  		- Since the specific location is not mentioned in the documentation, I used the unspecified code for Crohn's disease `K50.90`.
  		- The ICD-10-CM guidelines allow for using the unspecified code when the specific site is not documented.
  		- In this case, `K50.90` accurately represents the diagnosis without specifying the exact location within the gastrointestinal tract.
- `I10` (Hypertension)
	- **Rationale:** 
		- Emily has a history of controlled hypertension.
    		- I assign `I10` (Essential (primary) hypertension) as an additional diagnosis.
   		- Proper sequencing ensures that the primary diagnosis (Crohn's disease) takes precedence over hypertension.
- `E11.9` (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)
	- **Rationale:** 
    		- Emily requires insulin therapy for managing her type 2 diabetes.
    		- I assign `E11.9` (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) as an additional diagnosis.
    		- It's essential for me to document comorbidities that impact patient care and management.
- `M81.0` Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture)
	- **Rationale:** 
    		- Emily has a history of fragility related to osteoporosis.
	    	- I assign `M81.0` (Postmenopausal osteoporosis with pathological fracture) as an additional diagnosis.
    		- Proper coding reflects the patient's overall health status.
- `D50.9` (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified)
	- **Rationale:** 
		- We assign `D50.9` (Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified) as an additional diagnosis.
- `F32.9` (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified)
	- **Rationale:** Emily has depression and currently under untidepressant but no further specific informaion was mentioned.


#### 3. **Sequencing Rules**:
- **Explanation**:
  - We sequence the codes based on the reason for the encounter.
  - Since Emily is primarily seeking treatment for Crohn's disease symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue), we list it as the primary diagnosis.
  - Hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, and anemia are secondary diagnoses.
